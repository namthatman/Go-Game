#Go Game
Go is an abstract strategy board game popular in East Asian countries. The game is invented for two players, in which the aim is to surround more territory than the opponent. Go Game is a mini version of the game that developed for Window using C++ language. This game is more like the first playground for me and my teammates when we first got familiar with programming.
